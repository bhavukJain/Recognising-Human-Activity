# Recoginizing Human Activity Using Smartphones


### 1. Aim

The purpose of this project is to use the dataset provided at [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) for detecting regular human activities. This dataset has been prepared from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.  

### 2. Description of Dataset

Each record in the dataset has the following:
- A 561-feature vector with frequency and time variables.
- The corresponding activity label.
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- Identifier of subject on whom experiment was done.

### 3. Proposed Solution

The python code contains the implementation of SVM for preparing a learning model having an accuracy of approximately 91%. 

### 4. Libraries/Language

- Python 3.x
- Numpy, Scipy, Pandas
